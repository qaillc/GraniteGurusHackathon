# GraniteGurusHackathon

Granite Gurus Many Eyes is an evolution of three previous Hackathons: Build Your AI Startup, Codestral, and Edge Runners. This Hackathon introduced two powerful new principles: (1) Uniqueness and (2) Many Eyes. These principles were crucial in advancing the exploration of Multidimensional (MD) space and were demonstrated through a custom search engine built on top of IBM Granite, showcasing their effectiveness.

The Principle of Uniqueness asserts that spatial points can be arranged in any configuration as long as the number of points remains constant and each point is unique. This principle underpins the concept of the 2D Infinite Plane, which helps visualize what is happening in higher dimensions. Additionally, the entire system of MD-points can be represented on a single line, but it's essential to represent numeric values as symbols rather than numbers to reduce computational costs.

The Principle of Many Eyes posits that once one aspect of a system is known, the entire system can be understood due to the numerous symmetry operations available in MD-space. Unlike traditional programming, where a typical function has a single input and output, MD-systems can produce multiple outputs from a single input based on these symmetries. This principle was illustrated in our application of IBM Granite, where a pattern search was conducted. The search returned four results due to the symmetries in MD-space, and IBM Granite was used to predict the next pattern.

This project effectively demonstrated how these two principles could be harnessed to advance pattern recognition and prediction in complex multidimensional systems, showcasing the potential for these principles to be applied in various AI-driven fields.
